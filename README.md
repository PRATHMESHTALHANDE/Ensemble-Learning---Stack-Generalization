# Ensemble-Learning---Stack-Generalization
This file explores different machine learning algorithms such as pca for dimensionality reduction on an image dataset and the application of the ensemble learning technique "stacking" (stacked generalization) with various base learners, followed by prediction using a meta-model for face recognition.
